## Planet Little Helper

Planet’s Little Helper is a project designed for users beginning their journey in leading a more environmentally-friendly life. It’s ideal for those who want to do more, but don’t know where to start and feel a little overwhelmed.

The app offers personalised and realistic challenges according to the user’s lifestyle and preferences. Encompassing categories of food, travel, recycling and energy, the user can select a challenge to carry out each week. Users are able to view their challenges, and mark them as complete.

Planet’s Little Helper was built by an interdisciplinary team of six people from the UX, Web Development and Data Science tracks.
