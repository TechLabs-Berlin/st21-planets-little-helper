1,60b54873f81c532bd894292b,Fast fashion,"Rejecting fast fashion could prevent an estimated 0.3 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year (see impact calculations). It also helps force the fashion industry to address unsustainable practices. Whether buying natural materials like cotton or synthetic materials like polyester or nylon, all clothes have a very real carbon footprint. ","This week you will reflect on your shopping habits. Think if you really need to buy that cute dress or those cool shoes. If you are in real need of new apparel, buy second hand clothes from local (if possible charity-) shops or buy clothes made from recycled fabrics.",Recycling
2,60b54873f81c532bd8942929,Home energy,"With household energy accounting for around 30% of individual emissions, reducing your consumption is a simple way to reduce emissions.",During this week you should pay extra attention to turning off lights and appliances when not in use (that also includes not leaving them on stand-by ). You will also wash your clothes at low temperatures and air dry them.,Energy
3,60b54873f81c532bd8942920,Eat less meat and dairy,"Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. Studies suggest that a high-fibre, plant-based diet is also better for your health - so it can be a win-win.",For the next week you are going to eat meat and dairy product only twice.,Food
4,60b54873f81c532bd8942923,Conscious nutrition,It is important to be mindful of the water that we drink as well as the food that we eat. Organic food is more environmentally friendly and does not add any chemicals to the drinking water.,"Respecting your budget, try to maximize the percentage of organic groceries that you will buy this week ",Food
5,60b54873f81c532bd8942924,Raw,"Not all foods should be eaten raw, but many vegetables can be eaten in that way which saves energy. It is yet another environmentally friendly way to keep you and environment healthy.",This week you should eat 3 meals with a 75% or more of raw vegetables.,Food
6,60b54873f81c532bd8942921,Reduce your food waste,"Around a third of the food produced for human consumption (1.3 billion tonnes) is wasted each year. Food that goes to landfill rots and releases methane, a greenhouse gas that's far more potent than carbon dioxide. Food that goes to compost releases far less methane.","For the next week you should plan your meals in advance, do groceries accordingly and freeze your leftovers.",Food
7,60b54873f81c532bd894292a,Bulk/unpackaged,Purchasing foods in bulk is a good way to cut back energy and gas as you will not have to travel to the store as often. It also creates less garbage in the landfills.,Try and find a shop/supermarket that focuses on zero-waste to get your groceries for this week,Energy
8,60b54873f81c532bd8942922,Local and seasonal food,The best way to reduce the emissions caused by your food miles is to avoid products that have been flown-in or have been grown out of season in artificial conditions,During this week you will look up what fruit and veg is in season in your area before going to the shops. You will also check where food is from before buying it. If local - make sure it's in season.,Food
9,60b54873f81c532bd8942928,Choose your energy provider wisely,"Switching to a green energy tariff can reduce your personal emissions by approximately 1 tonne of CO2 per year. It also changes demand in the energy sector - helping to drive the transition to a clean energy future. The energy used to heat our homes, cook our food and power our appliances accounts for approximately 30% of the average person's annual emissions.","If you don't know if your energy source is green, you should use this week to find out. If it's not the case, take a look at the different provider options that are available in your city. When you switch to a green energy provider, it does not mean that all your electricity then comes from renewable sources. There is rarely unused capacity in renewable energy facilities, so the energy you consume may still be generated by burning fossil fuels. However, good green energy providers ensure that for every unit of energy you use, a unit is produced and put on the grid by a renewable source. This helps compensate your emissions and drives the industry towards renewable energy. Choose your new energy provider wisely.",Energy
10,60b54873f81c532bd8942925,Flights,"Flying is carbon intensive. The combustion of jet fuel releases a lot of carbon emissions. Per-passenger, a single long haul flight can generate more emissions than many people in the world produce in an entire year. If you are a frequent flyer, reducing the amount you fly will almost certainly be the most impactful way you can help fight climate change.","This week you should make a plan for your next vacation. Decide for a travel destination that is accesible via train or bus, if you book them in advance, they will be cheaper. If you can't avoid flying, use MyClimate (https://co2.myclimate.org/en/flight_calculators/new) to offset your emitions.",Travel
11,60b54873f81c532bd894292c,Single use,"It's difficult to quantify the climate impact of our over reliance on single use products. Plastic pollution is a huge environmental crisis, but it should be considered a separate, albeit connected, issue to the climate crisis. Plastic, particularly recycled plastic, can play an important part of our future when used in the right way and often has lower life-cycle emissions than non-plastic alternatives.  It is the over consumption of single use manufactured items - be they plastic, cardboard, wood, metal or paper - that needs to be addressed in the fight against climate change.","On this week you should focus on avoiding single use products in your day to day life as much as possible. Reduce, re-use, recycle - in that order. Consider the lifespan of the things you're buying and try to avoid single use products and packaging.",Recycling
12,60b54873f81c532bd8942926,Bike and legs,"Cycling and walking are completely carbon neutral. With transport making up around 30% of our individual emissions, choosing to walk or cycle instead of drive is a simple, impactful way to take action on climate change. Making short journeys by car is particularly polluting as the catalytic converters that reduce these pollutants don't work effectively on trips under 8 Kilometers",Walk or cycle in place of public transport or motorised private transport this week. This could mean cycling to school or parking a little further from work and walking the rest of the way.,Travel
13,60b54873f81c532bd8942927,Public transport,Emissions released when using public transport are far lower than when taking a car. Driving a car to work produces more than 4 times the carbon emissions as catching the train,"During this week you will use public transport for the majority of your commute to work or school. If your form of public transport has an app, download it to ensure you know the latest times and travel updates. Plan something you'd like to learn or read or watch during your commute.",Travel
